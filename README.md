# Data Engineering Internship

Stemming from my drive to build a data portfolio, this repo highlights my learnings embarking on an eight week (June - July 2019) remote internship working with contracting data and tools that make it accessible for analysis. It contains both created and curated resources that I developed and studied, which will be beneficial for anyone starting in the technical data space. 

For beginners, identifying a path of study is usually time consuming, overwhelming and stressful especially due to the abundance of resourses on the web. This usually makes you cave in and think of yourself as incompetent and incapable. I can relate to this experience as I've been there before many times. I created this repo with you in mind to help you develop practical data skills. 

By documenting and sharing my internship, I hope that you are inspired and motivated in going through this repo and able to acquire the skills I gained within the period.

- The [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jfarouk/Data-Engineering-Internship/blob/master/ocds-learning-lab/flatten-tool-tutorial/section_one_pandas_json_library.ipynb) for section one of the tutorial  
- The [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jfarouk/Data-Engineering-Internship/blob/master/ocds-learning-lab/flatten-tool-tutorial/section_two_flatten_tool.ipynb) for section two of the tutorial  
- A [data folder](https://github.com/jfarouk/Data-Engineering-Internship/tree/master/ocds-learning-lab/flatten-tool-tutorial/data) which has the sample [contract json data](https://github.com/jfarouk/Data-Engineering-Internship/blob/master/ocds-learning-lab/flatten-tool-tutorial/data/sample-ocds-award-data.json) and a [subfolder](https://github.com/jfarouk/Data-Engineering-Internship/tree/master/ocds-learning-lab/flatten-tool-tutorial/data/flattened_json(csv)) containing flat contract data in csv's
    
b. [Scraping contracts data with Beautiful Soup](https://github.com/jfarouk/Data-Engineering-Internship/tree/master/ocds-learning-lab/scraping-gh-contract-data-with-beautiful-soup)  
- My scraper in a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jfarouk/Data-Engineering-Internship/blob/master/ocds-learning-lab/scraping-gh-contract-data-with-beautiful-soup/scraping_gh_contracts_data.ipynb)  
- A [requirements.txt](https://github.com/jfarouk/Data-Engineering-Internship/blob/master/ocds-learning-lab/scraping-gh-contract-data-with-beautiful-soup/requirements.txt) file listing all the package and software dependancies to run the scraper  
- Scraped [data](https://github.com/jfarouk/Data-Engineering-Internship/blob/master/ocds-learning-lab/scraping-gh-contract-data-with-beautiful-soup/contract_data_ppa_gh.csv) in a csv file

c. [Contract Data cleaning](https://github.com/jfarouk/Data-Engineering-Internship/tree/master/ocds-learning-lab/cleaning-gh-contract-data)  
- A [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jfarouk/Data-Engineering-Internship/blob/master/ocds-learning-lab/cleaning-gh-contract-data/cleaning_gh_contract_data.ipynb) showing my cleaning process  
- The [data](https://github.com/jfarouk/Data-Engineering-Internship/blob/master/ocds-learning-lab/cleaning-gh-contract-data/contract_data_ppa_gh.csv) before cleaning  
- The cleaned [data](https://github.com/jfarouk/Data-Engineering-Internship/blob/master/ocds-learning-lab/cleaning-gh-contract-data/cleaned_gh_contract_data.csv)
